\title{Build linear model per feature}
\usage{
lm_loop(keyobj, datobj, fixed.vars, vars.to.scale = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{keyobj}{a dataframe of metadata; sequencing sample identifiers in collumn "ID"}

\item{datobj}{a matrix of taxa absolute/relative abundances; sequencing sample identifiers are in row.names. Rare taxa should be removed.}

\item{fixed.vars}{character vector of predictors for model (names of relevant columns in keyobj)}

\item{vars.to.scale}{chracter vector of names of fixed.vars that need to be scales beforemodelling (usually any numerical variable)}
}
\value{
table of all coefficnts for each microbial feature
}
\description{
Run linear model for each microbial taxon (like masslin but better)
}
